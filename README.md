# AB_Testing_Combined_Knowledges

AB testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, is a method used in marketing, product development, and other fields to compare two versions of a product or service to determine which one performs better. The two versions, typically labeled A and B, are shown to similar groups of users or customers, and their responses are compared to assess which version yields better outcomes.
